# Bank-Management-System
Developed a Bank Management System based on a YouTube tutorial originally using Python and SQL. I adapted it to Python and MongoDB for better flexibility and scalability. Features include account management, transaction history, and an admin portal. Currently adding a frontend with HTML/CSS for an enhanced UI.
